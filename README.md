# Runway-Detection


Nowadays a number of landing accidents takes place due to the lack of efficient systems. In order to avoid these situations, this project puts forward a method. The presence of fog is a major problem during the runway detection and localization. The clarity of observed images is harmed by fog in the environment. Dense fog reduces the visibility of the image taken from cameras. To begin with, the hazy content in the obtained image is removed using digital image processing technique to visually improve degraded visibility caused by atmospheric conditions.



The detection of the runway in the image is the next phase. A method of recognising runway in a picture is known as runway detection. To detect the presence of a runway, a deep learning technique is used. If the runway is present, in order to ensure safe landing, localization of the runway is performed i.e., identifying the exact path of the runway using a machine learning algorithm. The Hough transform algorithm detects and highlights the lines on the runway. hence helping the pilot for safe landing of the aircraft. If the aircraft follows the exact path which is localized then 90% of landing accidents can be avoided.
